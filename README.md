Email Marketing Campaign
Goal
Optimizing marketing campaigns is one of the most common data science tasks. Among the many marketing tools available, emails stand out as particularly efficient.
Emails are great because they are free, scalable, and can be easily personalized. Email optimization involves personalizing the content and/or the subject line, selecting the recipients, and determining the timing of the sends, among other factors. Machine Learning excels at this.
